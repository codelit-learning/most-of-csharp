# Introduction
Learn most of C# from this small repo.

## Running the programs
All folders except the `Oops` one contain self-contained programs which can be executed simply by importing the respective class and calling the `run()` method from `Program.cs`.

For `Oops` folder, look for the `Driver.cs` files as they contain the driver programs.

Then to run the program:
```sh
dotnet run
```
